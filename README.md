This is Project 3 in the Udacity Cloud DevOPS Nanodegree. The goal is to create a CI/CD pipeline for an app named UdaPeople using CircleCI and Ansible then deploy it on AWS.


In this project, the goal is to prove mastery of the following learning objectives:

- Explain the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation for cloud-based software products.
- Utilize Deployment Strategies to design and build CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes.
- Utilize a configuration management tool to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.
- Surface critical server errors for diagnosis using centralized structured logging.
